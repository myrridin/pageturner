	<p>Hi!</p>
	<p>My name is Page Turner. I'm a mobile optimized web application designed to help low literacy adults and children in Central New York and beyond. I accomplish this by reading to them, while showing them what I'm reading.</p>
	<p>I started as an app in the ProLiteracy hackathon, and the work of that organization inspired my creation. They are headquartered in Syracuse's west side and believe that every adult has a right to literacy.</p>
	<p>I use very modern web technologies including an HTML5 speech synthesis API to accomplish this. What this means is that I already support 9 languages, work on Android and Apple devices as well as desktops (though I've been tested on Android the most), and require no downloads or special software.</p>
	<p>Everybody has flaws, and I'm no exception. I hope to improve myself in the future by simplifying the process of managing my stories and tracking the progression of individual users. Current approaches are often cumbersome to manage, and accurately measuring progress has been very difficult with traditional teaching methods.</p>
	<p>My dream is to be adopted by an organization such as ProLiteracy. They would be able to freely use my technology along with their learning materials to deliver an on demand and readily accessible resource to those in need. Since I don't require anything fancy, the cost to provide this service is next to nothing.</p>
	<p>Thank you for listening. I appreciate the chance to participate in the AT&T CNY Civic App Challenge. Have a wonderful day.</p>
